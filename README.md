# 🌍 Global Sustainable Energy Analysis and 2030 Forecast

## Project Overview

This project analyzes **global energy consumption**, **renewable energy adoption**, and **CO₂ emissions** using the Our World in Data (OWID) dataset.

The core goals are:
1.  Visualize global and country-specific energy trends (2000s - present).
2.  Analyze the correlation between economic indicators (GDP) and energy metrics (CO₂, Renewables).
3.  Employ machine learning models (Linear, Polynomial, and Random Forest Regression) to **predict the global renewable energy share for the year 2030**.
